Implement an O(m + n) time algorithm for finding all cut vertices and cut edges in an undirected
graph.

Input: The first line will have two positive integers, n and m, which represent the number of vertices and the number of edges in the graph respectively, where the vertex set of the graph is {1,...,n}. Then, there will be m lines following, one for each undirected edge. Each line will have two numbers in {1, . . . , n}, representing the two vertices of the edge. You can assume that the input graph is connected. You can also assume that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10000000 and 1 ≤ m ≤ 30000000.

Output: The output will consist of two lines. In the first line, print the number of cut vertices, and then list all the cut vertices in increasing order. (If zero, then the list is empty.) In the second line, print the number of cut edges, and then list all the cut edges in lexicographical order. (If zero, then the list is empty.) See the sample output for the precise format.
